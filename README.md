### Team Members:

**Note for TA** We are mainly using discord to communicate what features we are currently working on
instead of solely using github issues. We may periodically create issues but prefer this method as it
forces us to communicate consistently.

## User Stories:

**Note for TA** These vary from our original blueprint submission on Markus. We have decided to not seperate
the account types into free/premium and instead focus on making the design/clean architecture
as best as possible (i.e. instead of over implementing features). However, we have decided
to replace the work of making multiple account types with a custom character
feature.
