# Character Chatbot Accessibility Report

## Principles of Universal Design

### Equitable Use:

Our program allows any and all users unlimited registration and access to
chatbots. Data is securely stored in MongoDB databases, ensuring privacy
by preventing users from accessing other people\'s data. In addition,
the program is designed such that there is only one type of account and the same
services for all users. This ensures that no demographic is segregated and all
experiences with character chatbot provide the same opportunities.

### Flexibility in Use:

Our chatbot services give users the option to customize their experience,
including the choice of chatting with several default characters. 
To ensure the adaptability of our program to a wide range of preferences, we also
offer the ability to customize your own character! This includes creating a 
personalized character from scratch, or chatting with any of one your favourite,
existing personalities.

### Simple and Intuitive Use:

The chatbot\'s interface is easy to use, with simple buttons and clear
instructions. Users can easily click to have a conversation, suitable
for a wide range of user groups. The interface also makes sure to include
clear and concise instructions for all chatting services. This includes the 
explanation in the main logged in view, telling a user how to chat with one of 
our default characters.

### Perceptible Information:

The interface is designed with well-organized buttons, each clearly
labeled to guide the user through its functions. This ensures that users
can easily navigate the program without getting confused. In the future,
we'd also like to implement text to speech and 
audio outputs for bot responses. This would allow us to diversify our compatibility 
for users with various reading/writing limitations.

### Tolerance for Error:

Our program provides users with the ability to correct errors, such as
allowing them to ask the chatbots to forget certain inputs or restart
conversations if necessary. Our bots are also advanced enough to understand inputs
with spelling and grammatical errors, treating them as if there were no errors. The 
same applies to the creation of custom bots where a user can misspell their 
favourite character's name or occupation and still receive the expected experience.

### Low Physical Effort:

The program requires only the basic input of a keyboard and mouse,
minimizing the physical effort required by the user. This makes it
accessible to people with limited mobility.

### Size and Space for Approach and Use:

The chatbot is designed as a computer application that can be adapted to
any typical computer space, ensuring that it can be accessed through a
variety of devices, and that space requirements are minimal. Aside from this,
the principle does not really apply to a purely computer based application such as
ours. The size and space factors are based more on the user's personal computer
setup than the program itself.

## Potential Target Audience

Our software is primarily aimed at people who enjoy interacting with
characters, such as fans of specific characters like Yoda, Mickey Mouse,
or Darth Vader. Users can have fun talking to their favorite
characters in the app. Going forward, our program could expand to
simulate the voice and writing style of deceased loved ones through
photos and letters, helping people reconnect with their deceased loved
ones. This feature can help those who are coping with the loss of a
loved one feel connected and comforted. Overall, this program could be targeted
at anyone who has a desire to talk to a specific persona, regardless of whether that character is fictional. This provides a broad range of market
opportunities.

## Demographic Considerations

Our program is likely to appeal to a wide range of people because
everyone has some form of social need, and many users are interested in
interacting with their favorite characters. While the program is
designed for everyone, certain groups of people, such as people who
aren\'t interested in avatars or social interactions, may be less
willing to use it. However, based on its broad appeal, our program is
more likely to appeal to users who enjoy role-playing or seek
companionship through virtual means. Considering the embedded ethics modules
this term, it is possible that certain users with visual disabilities (regardless 
of whether we consider the cause as social or medical) are less likely to use
our application. Of course, we hope to mitigate this distinction in the future
by incorporating text to speech and audio responses from our various chatbots.
